As an only child to an asian family, I had to uphold the stereotype of being an excellent student. It was too much pressure on me and I retaliated by being an extrovert who never focused on education. I had no future and no plans of shaping my pathway to the open world from high school to community college. By hitting rock bottom, it was the year where I got a reality check; I needed to plan for my career in order to survive.

After finishing Asian American Studies as my major at University of California, Riverside, I had half a year left and did not want to graduate early as I knew that I had no future with this degree. Since one of my hobby deals with electronics, I decided to pursue a minor in Computer Science as I enjoyed taking an intro class to see what it was like. I started off learning C++ as my first language. I took an extra year in order to successfully finish the minor. What I enjoyed about learning computer science was that it was extremely difficult and challenging as the courses were extensive compared to the pathway that was layed out for my major but it was quite rewarding whenever I acheived my goal. Besides math, I never felt the urge of wanting to learn until I came across computer science courses and this is the reason why I want to keep pursuing this pathway for my career.

After graduating, having only a minor degree and no experience in Los Angeles was extremely difficult to land any type of job interviews as I have no decent knowledge or any way to showcase my skills. Eventually, I landed a job in a healthcare company as a Data Analyst. It's nothing close to being a software developer but I thought it might help me reach closer to my goal by learning what being a data analyst was all about. After two years, the company was involved in a scandle that lead to shutting down the company resulting in over 1,000 employees being unemployed. After struggling yet again to find a job, I came across a repair service company that worked for Samsung.

This was the moment where I decided that I needed to adapt and change my life. After a year, I wanted a career change. I knew that if I continued to be a data analyst, I would stay miserable and my happiness is what matters the most. Despite the fact that I have little money and have no source of income other than work due to being independent at an aparment, it was better for me to quit, take the bootcamp to change my life, and work on Lyft during weekends than to just keep working on an okay salary where it will get me nowhere.

Now that I am unemployed and taking this bootcamp course, I am ready. This will be another difficult and challenging obstacle that I need to overcome. I am determined, I will succeed. I will utilize all the tools that are available to the extent of my abilities.
