Hello and welcome.

SQL is a familiar topic as I've learned the basics of how SQL works and how to extract data onto Excel in order to work with data. Before I joined Flatiron (which I pronounced as Flatter-on before finding out it's actually Flat Iron), I was a Data Analyst for three years. What I never realized was that SQL can coexist with other languages such as Ruby. I thought that SQL was on its own environment so I only used strictly SQL block codes in order to extract data.

Since SQL isn't really a programming language, my cohort seemed to struggle a tad bit to understand how joins worked. Once we reached to the topic of ORM and Active Record (which was also new to me), that's when everything seemed easier even though more complicated topics were introduced. The fact that it was becoming more Ruby based and less SQL code blocks, it made it easier to understand everything else. I think this was the week where my cohort went through the course without any real problems.

Now that I know languages can be used in order to extract data from an SQL database, this can be used in the future of my career. I will conquer. I will succeed.
