At first, I had an idea of what type of app I wanted to make but having the idea planned out was difficult. Just like on any essays, one of the hardest part is to start the essay. I wanted to create an app that deals with basketball. After making a mental diagram, what better way to connect my previous project onto this? This was the perfect opportunity as the purpose of this is to build an app where it allows the user to create his own fantasy where the user adds current NBA players to make an All Star roster.

It may sound simple but having to start from scratch was a lot harder than expected. With the knowledge and tools available, it was simple enough to have all the basis to work such as modules and database migrations but I did all of this the hard way. After trying to figure out how to get the app to work, I had no choice but to turn to my cohort lead. He introduced me to Corneal, where it made everything easier and get the application to work in terms of basics.

The most difficult part of the app was creating a page where a user picks out players in order to create an all star roster. Not only does this page involves the previous project, it also has different languages to make the form work by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby. It took tremendous amount of time to get the tables working and forced me to change the idea of the page couple of times to not make things complicated for the user by giving out restrictions.

Even though I have struggled tremendously on this app and was frustrated because things weren't going the way I wanted it to, it was fun since it was challenging which made me learn new aspects, giving me a concrete experience.
There are a few minor situations that I need to consider and fix. I also want to have this app on a live website instead of having to go to my github repository and test the app from there.

Probably my first "real" struggle and I enjoyed it every step of the way. I will conquer. I will suceed.
