Hello,

Yes, I'm alive. I was in a position where I might have gotten moved to a different cohert because I was far behind from everyone else. Definitely was in a huge panic mode for three weeks until it was almost too late. I wouldn't say I "clutched" it but I barely made it out alive by completing my rails project.

This is by far the toughest subject I dealt with in the cohort. Making an app remotely similar to AirBnB was a huge task that I thought I can do without struggling this much. Despite the panic, anxiety, and stress, I didn't give up. There were times where I had to get away from the project and have my "me" time for my own sanity but besides that, I grinded. I have what it takes to learn and I will never give up.

I enjoyed working on this project as I have learned a lot from it. From making simple partial forms to uploading images for user and another class, it was all enjoyable. I faced a lot of challenges where it took me hours on end to figure out what the problems were and it could be something very easy to catch (like that one extra character that wasn't needed). Even then, I still enjoy all of the frustration because it's challenging.

I'm still on the brink of falling behind so I need to keep moving forward and not look back. I will succeed. I will conquer. I will overcome all the obstacles.
