A lot has happened during the journey to finish the last project of the course. I was struggling financially as I am living independentally and quit my job to become a full-time student. Took quite amount of gruesome time but I have overcome one part of road block, which is to find some time to actually work on the project.

Took about two weeks max to work on it and of course, I have struggled mightly with different issues such as meeting any of the requirements, how to get props and state to work properly, and etc.

My first problem was to figure out what type of API I wanted to use. After researching for a huge amount of time, I noticed that API's given through the internet usually have free trials and those have limitations such as calling the api in a specific amount of time per day and month. Not only that, either the API had too much data to go through or it didn't have the necessary data that I wanted. Ultimately, I decided to create my own API through rails. It took a lot of time to create two API's for me to use but it was simple, clean, and useable.

In the react side, I had a difficult time understanding how many components I needed, how to use thunk correctly, and using dispatch options in the correct way. After reading multiple guides/articles, numerous different attempts of getting the results, and brainstorming, I have successfully implemented an app that has RESTful routing, using fetch to get data from my own API, countless routes, couple of containers, multiple stateless components, and a middleware to modify state change.

The hardest challenge for the project was working with dispatch and action. I didn't really understand how it worked coming into the project even though I have passed majority of the labs regarding react. Even after reading articles about them, I still couldn't really understand how it worked until a cohort showed me examples by inserting debugger in some of the cases and functions. After about several hours, I finally reached my end goal which was to complete the search function of a certain list.

Overall, I am thankful that Flatiron has options for me to finish the course as it seems that the program was built to understand that people can be facing a lot of obstacles outside of the progam and it can happen anywhere at any moment. I am excited to start my new journey as I am hoping to graduate as soon as I can so I can face new challenges.

I know that I can't be relaxing as the real challenge is to crack those interviews and land a job that I want. I will succeed. I will conquer these challenges.
