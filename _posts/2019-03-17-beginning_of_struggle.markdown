This week has been a struggle. As a matter of fact, I have been struggling to stay healthy this year as I have gotten sick twice already! This week gave me the issue of not being able to concentrate on anything because of the constant, violent, and never-ending coughs. With sleep deprivation and headaches, it was actually a nightmare to even concentrate on this weeks project.

At the beginning of learning how scraping works, it was quite a struggle as it was completely new to me and I had no idea what I was doing. Once I figured things out by testing a tremendous amount of different possibilities, it became quicker and easier to understand. It took me about twelve hours to figure out that ESPN website was unscrapeable due to javascript. I know exactly the pinpoint of which was scrapeable and which wasn't and unfortunately, in the part where it's unscrapeable, was the main part of data that I needed.

Fortunately, I found something similar to ESPN website that had no javascript involved in the data I scraped. My first task was to scrape every data I needed for my project. Didn't take too long. Then I got stuck on what I should do, how I should present it, and in what way. I brainstormed and tried to figure out what my next step should be. To me, this was probably the same struggle as everyone has in the beginning part of their essay, not being able to start right away but to brainstorm and figure out how to start the essay.

After speaking with our Cohort lead, the ideas were more precise. It took quite some time to give a formatted output so that any users can read and understand what the program is doing. There is a lot of refactoring to do as I know there are repetitive codes in multiple files. I also need to fully understand how github works and the whole business with gems. Unfortunately, this blog post is due today so not only do I start with the struggle, I stay struggling after finishing the post.

I Will Conquer. I Will Overcome any Obstacles. I Will Succeed.
