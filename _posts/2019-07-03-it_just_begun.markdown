Learning JavaScript was challenging and fun at the same time. I appreciate using the fetch tool as it got from complicated to figuring out creative ways to figure the data out. The program became very fast paced ever since Rails were introduced and it just keeps going. Feels like just yesterday that I have started the program but I know that more challenges awaits. Looking forward to learning new topics even if I am behind. I will conquer. I will succeed.
