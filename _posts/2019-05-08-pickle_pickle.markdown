I am at the point where I would say that I am definitely in a pickle. Before we reached our second week break of the course, I was already behind. Before the week break even began, I had to cut the lessons short on Friday to go on a week and a half long vacation to Vietnam to attend at a Bachelor's party. Luckily, it was basically the same time as it was with the cohort's second week break. Now that I'm back, I am even more behind as more materials fell through and am definitely at that "oh I'm screwed" point.

Not only am I behind, I am finally at a material where I admit that it is quite difficult to understand every single concept that's being taught at the moment. I thought learning Rails would be an easier task than learning Sinatra but I was wrong by a mile. That's okay as this is an actual challenge for me where I might need to re-learn all of these materials even after I went through all the labs since I don't quite fully understand everything. Bring on the challenge!

I will succeed. I will conquer. I will overcome these challenges.
